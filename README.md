**Welcome to our Tech Tutor e-learning platform**

Upon accessing the Tech Tutor e-learning platform, users will encounter a main page featuring three prominent buttons: "Main Portal," "About this Tech Tutor Portal," and "Contact Us." These buttons lead to specific sections, each catering to different aspects of the platform.


**1. Main Portal:**
Within the Main Portal, four distinct user functionalities are available:
a) Student: Students have two primary options. If they already possess an account, they can log in directly. Otherwise, new students can choose the sign-up option. Once successfully logged in, students can update their profiles, access information about available courses based on professors, subjects, and semesters. Using this information, students can register for specific subjects. The portal also includes a "Transcript Request" section where students can view completed courses and, if completed, rate the course. Students can request transcripts from the admin and view their transcripts after approval. Additionally, students can send graduation requests to the third-party GradCertify authority to determine their eligibility for graduation.

b) Professor: Professors also have two options: to log in with an existing account or to register a new one. After a successful login, professors can view and manage their created courses. They can enable or disable courses according to their requirements. Professors can also access information about past students who have completed their courses and grade ongoing students. Furthermore, professors can create courses, specifying parameters like region, language, day, time, and semester.

c) Admin: Upon login, administrators have two main functions. Firstly, they can view pending student transcript requests and decide whether to accept them based on student profiles. Secondly, admins can access user feedback about the platform in a tabular format, providing valuable insights for improvement.

d) GradCertify (Third Party): After a successful login, GradCertify authority can view pending graduation requests from students, along with their relevant information. They can then authorize or deny these requests based on student readiness for graduation.


**2. About Us:**
The "About Us" section offers comprehensive information about the background of Tech Tutor, its mission, vision, and highlights its top recruiters. Users can gain a deeper understanding of the platform's goals and values in this section.

  
**3. Contact Us:**
In the "Contact Us" section, users are provided with contact information, including an email address. This allows users to reach out to the e-learning platform in case they encounter issues or have inquiries. It also serves as a channel for users to provide feedback, which is directed to the platform's administrators for review and action. Tech Tutor E-Learning Platform offers a robust set of features for students, professors, administrators, and the GradCertify authority while also providing transparency and accessibility through the "About Us" and "Contact Us" sections.
